## EFFECTS 🎛️

### CROSSFEED 🎧

Centers the signal via `Feed` | `Cutoff` sets the limit of frequencies it affects.

### 1ST EQUALIZER | MULTIBAND COMPRESSOR 🎲

They attenuate the input signal, giving space to the mix.

### BASS ENHANCER 💪

It makes it sound crunchier.

### FILTER 🚿️

Applies a `High-Pass` filter that eliminates bass. Switch to `Low-Pass` to do the opposite.

### 2ND / 3RD / 4TH EQUALIZER 🧬

They expand the signal recreating a simple / smooth / harsh `Dolby Atmos`

### 2ND MULTIBAND COMPRESSOR ❤️‍🔥

Increases the dynamic range of bass, midrange and treble.

### COMPRESSOR 🔥️

Increases the dynamic range of the signal making it sound fuller.

### REVERBERATION ⛰️

Creates a bedroom. Try going beyond these values, you can achieve creative results with some practice.

### DELAY | STEREO TOOLS 👥️

They create a stereo separation effect.

### AUTOGAIN 🛠

Normalizes the volume based on a `Target` | `Reset History` re-evaluates this operation (refresh) | `Maximum History` is arbitrary.

### LIMITER | MAXIMIZER 👂️

They prevent the signal from exceeding 0 dB and becoming distorted | `Threshold` can replace `Autogain` in exchange for messing up dynamics.

### LEVEL METER 🔊️

Helps to find the true perceived loudness of the signal.

## TIPS ✨

### DOWNWARD / UPWARD COMPRESSION 📈

To achieve different styles, you can set the `Release Time` to 0.00, 100.00, 200.00, 300.00, 400.00 or 500.00 ms, the `Ratio` to 1.20:1, 1.50:1, 2.00:1, 3.00:1 or 6.00:1 and the `Reactivity` to 10.00, 25.00, 50.00, 125.00 or 250.00 ms

### MIN / MAX LATENCY 👀️

There are two versions: one with minimal latency and one with high latency. Choose the one that best suits your needs. From a practical standpoint, they may seem the same, but they differ in technical aspects: The `min` version is stable and works in all possible scenarios. The `max` version requires more processing and is experimental, but it may sound more professional.

### ON OR OFF 🤔

Some effects are disabled by default, be sure to turn them on and try them out. If you liked it, save it by rewriting the original file.

## COMPATIBILITY ISSUES ⚠️

Since we **DO NOT** support old versions, it is vital that you have the current stable branch for them to work.
